"""perception/anti_phase.py -- negative (anti-phase) coupling sources.

The coupled-phase oscillator (dynamics/oscillator.py) separates two cliques
only when the coupling matrix can say NO: a negative edge weight drives the
phase difference toward pi instead of toward 0. Measured before this module
existed (diagnostics/_a6_maskfree_result.json, M4/A6 result): the observed
graph for two-panel composites carried 146 edges, 146 with sign=+1 and ZERO
anti-phase, 118 of them EDGE_CONTACT proximity noise -- so two-panel
separation could not be positive for a structural reason, not a tuning one.

Two sources, both geometric, both computable from the live field's own
detections:

  1. Border ownership -- opposite flank owners across a shared boundary.
     A BorderOwnership detection names two entities: the entity whose
     boundary it is (rho "entity") and the entity on the far side of that
     boundary (rho "neighbor"). Those two are the owners of the opposite
     flanks of one shared boundary, which is the figure-ground / occlusion
     relation, and it is a reason to separate rather than to bind.

  2. Containment -- closed-chain interior vs exterior. A PEAK_CHAIN whose
     closure slot is set and whose member ring encloses another
     detection's anchor separates that detection (interior) from the ring
     (exterior): the ring is one surface's silhouette, the enclosed
     structure sits behind it on another depth layer.

Both sources are pure functions of detections plus anchor positions, so
they are testable without an image, and deterministic: every iteration is
over sorted keys and every tie-break is explicit.

WHY THE DIRECTION SLOT IS READ THROUGH THE UNIFIED DECODER
---------------------------------------------------------
The BorderOwnership direction slot (quantized[1]) is a SIGNED figure-ground
scalar (`_q_signed(signed_dir, 8)`: bins 0-3 = the entity is the ground, bins
4-7 = the entity is the figure), NOT an angle. Three readers once disagreed:

  * perception/lenses/v2.py ContourLens: treated it as an 8-bin direction over
    2*pi, compared with an edge bearing (a category error, since fixed);
  * orchestration/binder.py `_run_border_ownership_edge`: treated it as an
    AXIAL angle over pi, `(bin + 0.5) * pi / 8` (a category error, since fixed);
  * orchestration/binder.py `_bo_depth_constraints`: `(bin + 0.5)/8*2 - 1`, a
    signed scalar -- the reading that matches the producer.

`perception/ownership.py` is now the SINGLE decoder for that slot; every reader
above, and this module's `border_ownership_claims_directed`, go through it, so
the conventions cannot drift again. The slot's polarity orders the flank pair
figure -> ground here; the earlier note that it "carries no side information"
described a corpus where no per-vertex cue voted on figure (all-positive z), not
the slot's contract.
