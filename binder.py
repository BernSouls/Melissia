"""binder.py — Canonical binder module for Blueprint v31.

Implements §2.3: ten binders producing relations between two or more
distinct entities. Every binder compares lens-produced pattern nodes and emits
an order-1 edge. There are NO order-2 edge types: structural similarity is a
measurement of the graph the binders already produced, not an observed
relation, so it lives in structural_similarity.py (§1.5/§4.12) and emits
nothing.

Order-1:
    Co-activation   A and B fire in the same step          (undirected)
    Transition      A onsets at t, B onsets at t+1          (directed)
    Co-motion       A and B move together                   (undirected)
    Contrast        B appears iff A is present              (directed)
    Periodicity     A recurs with interval T relative to B  (undirected)
    Persistence     A stable while B changes                (directed)
    Topology        B is one of A's K nearest neighbors     (directed)
    Degree          B is within radius R of A               (undirected)
    Contact         A contacts B                            (undirected)
    Sequence        A precedes B with age decay             (directed)

Determinism
-----------
All iteration, sorting, and tie-breaking is by canonical bytes.
Per-channel homeostatic state mirrors §2.7 (theta, r_bar, C, F, M_prev).
Same input produces byte-identical output, run to run.

      Rule 1 — EVENT_CAUSAL / TEMPORAL_CHAIN:
        A SEQUENCE edge (temporal priority: A precedes B) indicates a causal
        family. sourceLayer decides which:
          max(source_layer) == 0 → EVENT_CAUSAL

      Rule 2 — SPATIAL_OBJECT:
        Two or more spatial lens types in the detection set.

      Rule 3 — RECURSIVE_COMPOSITION:
        A higher-layer detection (max(source_layer) >= 1) combined with a
        heterogeneous edge set (>= 2 distinct relation channels). A
        composition of compositions is recognized by its *mixed* relations
        rather than by an order-2 edge: the STRUCTURAL_SIMILARITY edge type
        was removed (§1.5/§4.12 — comparison is a measurement, not a
        relation), so the rule now reads the relation structure directly.
        Subgraphs already claimed by Rule 1 are excluded, so a causal chain
        is never re-classified as a recursive composition.

      Rule 4 — CROSS_DOMAIN_PATTERN:
        Same lens type, two or more distinct substrates.

    [v31 FLAT-TAXONOMY NOTE] Under v31 the six concept-derived lenses
    (ConceptSequence, ConceptStructure, Convergence, Divergence,
    ConceptDegree, ConceptRhythm) have been removed. Causality is now
    encoded as edge structure and read here. The v30 detection-only rule
    fired on raw "Sequence" + "Structure" detections; those no longer
    exist (they became the SEQUENCE binder), so the rule now fires on the corresponding edges.

    Returns None if no rule matches; the candidate is a scaffold and MUST

        Why: SEQUENCE edges require strictly positive lag (parent onset
        before child onset). The effects of action a_t appear in the
        observation at step t+1 — the same step the Action lens would
        naturally emit a_t (as `prev_action`). Emission-time onset would
        make action and effect co-onset (lag 0 ⇒ no edge) and instead
        misattribute the NEXT step's effects to a_t. Pre-registering the
        onset at execution time yields lag = 1 action→effect edges —
        correct causal attribution — and consecutive actions still chain
        (A(a_t) onset t → A(a_{t+1}) onset t+1) for §5.3.4 replay order.

        Mechanics: creates/refreshes the pattern node, pins
        _pattern_last_onset to t, and marks the pattern present-prev so
        the lens emission at t+1 extends presence WITHOUT re-onsetting.
        A repeated action re-executed at t+1 refreshes its onset (each
        execution is a fresh causal event, keeping lag = 1 to its own
        effects). Deterministic; O(1).

        makes no claim about V1/V2 disparity neurons beyond the general fact
        that depth separation signals object boundaries. The channel name is

        orientation and its spatial frequency; strength is slot 3. Sharpness
        now reads slot 3 (slot 2 as a 3-slot fallback), and curvature is

        AXIAL (mod pi), so it is binned to 12 with a declared 12-cycle and
