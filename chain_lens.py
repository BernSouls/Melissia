"""perception/lenses/chain_lens.py -- [A5] ChainLens.

Groups the continuous contour field's peaks into chains via
`perception.chain_formation.form_chains` and emits one PEAK_CHAIN detection
per chain, with rho roles linking it to its member CONTOUR_PEAKs.

Why this exists
---------------
`form_chains` returns (indices, is_ring) tuples. A bare tuple is not visible
to the graph: this lens emits a canonical chain detection with explicit
membership roles. PeakLens owns member peak detections; the Binder resolves
those roles into containment edges (container -> member).

Anchor scheme
-------------
Peak and chain anchors are computed from their index in the field output, so
any lens can reference one without a lookup table:

    peak  i            -> PEAK_ANCHOR_BASE + i
    chain ordinal k    -> PEAK_ANCHOR_BASE + CHAIN_ANCHOR_OFFSET + k

PEAK_ANCHOR_BASE is far above any pipeline-internal anchor counter, so the
field's anchors cannot collide with region anchors or binder synthesised
anchors.

    5 length_bin           graded  0..7    total length / (8 * median_wavelength)

Slot 1 is circular: CONTOUR_PEAK's theta axis is pi-periodic, so the mean is
computed on doubled angles and folded back, and the bin is taken modulo 12 to
satisfy the registry's N/2 range convention (range 6.0 over cycle 12).
