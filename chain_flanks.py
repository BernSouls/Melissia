"""perception/chain_flanks.py -- [Slice 2] Per-member flank fields on chains.

W1's identity-carrying lenses (BorderOwnership, Color, Texture, Boundary)
used to be keyed by SEGMENTER region anchors. Slice 0b proved that pathway
is empty on this tree (`entity_indices` is 0 on every image), and Slice 0c
showed the consequence: Surface emitted 8 detections that collapsed to 3
signatures because its material slots were driven by inputs keyed to
anchors that no detection shares.

This module re-keys those descriptors to CHAIN membership instead. For every
chain member it looks at both flanks of the local contour direction:

    offset = PERPENDICULAR_SCALE * median_wavelength      (scale-free)
    left flank  = centre + offset * ( -dy,  dx) / |d|
    right flank = centre + centre + offset * (  dy, -dx) / |d|

Each flank yields (luminance, opponent) sampled from the channels the front
end already computed. Ownership is then the signed difference of flank
statistics -- which side is "figure" is decided by the data, not by an
arbitrary label, and a chain with no flanks yields nothing rather than a
constant.

Neural analogue
---------------
Border-ownership (V2) is computed from texture/color/luminance contrast
ACROSS a boundary, not from the boundary alone: a contour owns the side
that is coherent with the figure. Sampling both flanks at an offset
proportional to the local spatial-frequency wavelength is the same
comparison at the scale the contour itself lives on.
